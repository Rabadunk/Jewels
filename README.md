An energy monitor application designed in parallel with an energy monitor device made the the University of Auckland course ELECTENG209.

## Project overview

Depletion of fossil fuels, irresponsible and inefficient utilization of energy and consequent adverse impacts on the environment are current global concerns. These concerns have lead to a global awareness of renewable generation and sustainable utilization of energy, in an attempt to reduce the reliance on oil, coal and gas to generate electricity.Consequently, billions of dollars are being invested worldwide in energy-related research and development projects in search for efficient, cost-effective, and reliable technologies. Fueled by the significant investments made in the energysector, the global renewable energy capacity has steadily increased over the last decade. To further promote the widespread use of renewable energy, effective new technologies such as decentralized energy generation  (DEG), smart houses and smart grids have been introduced recently. However, these new technologies essentially require some form of smart monitoringas well as control subsystems to allow for efficient generation and sustainable use of energy. The goal of this project, therefore,is to design and develop a wireless energy monitorto measure and display the amount of energyconsumed by an appliancein a smart house. During this project you will be working as part of a design team of fourstudents, who will undertake an investigation and subsequently develop a prototype energymonitor.
